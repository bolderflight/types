# Types

**Warning** This is an early work in progress.

This library defines common data types for use across our libraries. The vision is that different sensors, state estimators, and effectors will have unique configuration structs, but share a common data output struct to enable interchangability. This should also include enough introspection and reflection to enable serialization for data transmission and storage.
